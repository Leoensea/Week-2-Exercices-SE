Questions: Payments

- Why do modern payment cards use a chip and not a magnetic stripe?
Modern cards are using a chip, because it improves security (with associated fraud reduction), and offers the possibility for finer control of "offline" credit-card 
transaction approvals. 

- What are EMV Certificates and why are they relevant for payment protection?
EMV certification is a rigorous testing and approval process that validates the compliance of payment devices. 
It's important because it ensures that these devices are capable of securely processing chip-enabled payment cards and protecting sensitive cardholder data during transactions.

- What attacks exist against payment cards?
  - Card-not-present : 
    - Phishing
    - Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
  - Contactless payment : 
    - relay attacks
    - Eavesdropping
    - Skimming on NFC Readers

Questions: MFA

- How is multi-factor authentication (MFA) used in banking?
MFA requires users to provide two or more authentication factors (categories) before their access is granted.
It asks for something you know most commonly is a password and something you have like receiving a unique password. 
It is used in banks, for access to these accounts (at a certain frequency), or before any transfer for example, etc.

- How does multi-factor authentication increase payment security?
