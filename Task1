### Task 1A: Browsers and Banking Security

- What does the "Not Secure" warning mean in the first picture and what risks does visiting sites with the warning pose?

The "Not Secure" warning means that the website is still in HTTP (Hypertext protocol transfer) - and isn't secure. 
This means that a third party could see the information you send or receive through this site.
This can cause : 
  - leak of personal information (passwords, credit card data)
  - phishing attacks
  - installing malware on your computer
