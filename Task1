### Task 1A: Browsers and Banking Security

- What does the "Not Secure" warning mean in the first picture and what risks does visiting sites with the warning pose?

The "Not Secure" warning means that the website is still in HTTP (Hypertext protocol transfer) - and isn't secure. 
This means that a third party could see the information you send or receive through this site.
This can cause : 
  - leak of personal information (passwords, credit card data)
  - phishing attacks
  - installing malware on your computer

- Why does the second site show up as "trusted" to the browser?

The second website has a locker which means it is using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). It is the combination of HTTP with a TLS encryption layer.
This protocol ensures the confidentiality of data and protects their integrity during the transfer of information, from the Internet user's computer to the visited website.

- What other ways are there to detect a phishing/scam site?
It exists different ways to detect a phishing/scam site : 
  - pay attention to the link and the correct spelling
  - pay attention to the quality of content and design
  - check the age of the site. Fraudulent sites are often recent
  - ensure that there is a privacy policy
  - ensure that the payment methods offered are usual

Exemple of tools available online : 
  - Google Safe Browsing (https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search) 
  - Virustotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
  - PhishTank (https://phishtank.org)

- What is typosquatting and how does it relate to the pictures?

Typosquatting is a form of cybersquatting consisting of registering a domain name very close to a generally well-known domain name. 
It is based on typing or spelling errors made by Internet users during the search, thus making it possible to direct the Internet user to a site other than the one sought.
On the picture, we can see : 
  - danskebank.io/sinulle/sinulle 
  - danskebank.fi/sinulle/sinulle
The first one is misspelled and will direct the Internet user to a site other than the one sought

What is UDRP and how does it help with combatting typosquatting?
UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy) is a policy where trademark-based domain disputes must be resolved through agreement, court action, 
or arbitration before a registrar can cancel, suspend, or transfer a domain name. 
Disputes involving cybersquatting can be addressed through expedited proceedings filing a complaint. 

If you were to own the domain ouspg.org and would be running your crypto banking application at bank.ouspg.org, what domains could you monitor for warning signs of possible 
phishing attempts against your customers?
The domains I could monitor for warning signs of possible phishing attempts against my customers are : 
  - mispelling of ouspg.org and bank
  - add of other words (prefixe/suffixe)
