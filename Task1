### Task 1A: Browsers and Banking Security

- What does the "Not Secure" warning mean in the first picture and what risks does visiting sites with the warning pose?

The "Not Secure" warning means that the website is still in HTTP (Hypertext protocol transfer) - and isn't secure. 
This means that a third party could see the information you send or receive through this site.
This can cause : 
  - leak of personal information (passwords, credit card data)
  - phishing attacks
  - installing malware on your computer

- Why does the second site show up as "trusted" to the browser?

The second website has a locker which means it is using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). It is the combination of HTTP with a TLS encryption layer.
This protocol ensures the confidentiality of data and protects their integrity during the transfer of information, from the Internet user's computer to the visited website.
